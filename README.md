## Instructors

Principal Instructor : [Dr. Aris Cahyadi Risdianto](https://github.com/ariscahyadi)  
Co-Principal Instructor : [Sristi Lakshmi Sravana Kumar](https://github.com/sristisravan)

## Overview 
This module is one of the two modules where students get to practice information security concepts learned in the classroom with more hands-on experience. Students work in a group to learn, discuss, develop, analyze, and fix the security of applications. This module is aligned with an emerging paradigm of DevSecOps. 

## Description
This module is trying to help students in applying information security concepts in the software development process. Students are expected to discuss and analyze an application development along with the security concepts related to the deployment of the application. Then, students work in a group to develop the application and fix the security threats/holes of that application. Project activities include proposing and discussing (i.e., pitching) ideas for application development and security solution, developing/testing basic applications, and analyzing/fixing the security vulnerability of the application using open-source tools. 

## Objective: 
After completing this module, students should gain confidence and experience in participating and contributing to a team in developing an application and analyzing the security vulnerability of that application. They should also have better knowledge and deeper experience in applying various information security concepts and practices in a real-world scenario and environment. 

## Grading:  
Project and Assignment – 100

### Project/Assignment Grading

Final Grade = (60% x Grading 1) + (40% x Grading 2)

#### Grading 1 (Project and Team Satisfaction)

- It is taken based on the mid-term survey
- It is used "modified" version of [Net Promoter Score (NPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter)

**NOTE** : All Assignment will be given "pass" result, so it will not affect the final grading

#### Grading 2 (Project and Group Peer-Review)

- It is taken based on the final-term survey using [Luminus system](https://luminus.nus.edu.sg)
- It will be done during final presentation and demonstration on **April 22nd 2021**
- Every member of the group will give mark for other groups
