# TIC4302 - Course Syllabus

## Overview 
This module is one of the two modules where students get to practice information security concepts learned in the classroom with more hands-on experience. Students work in a group to learn, discuss, develop, analyze, and fix the security of applications. This module is aligned with an emerging paradigm of DevSecOps. 

## Description
This module is trying to help students in applying information security concepts in the software development process. Students are expected to discuss and analyze an application development along with the security concepts related to the deployment of the application. Then, students work in a group to develop the application and fix the security threats/holes of that application. Project activities include proposing and discussing (i.e., pitching) ideas for application development and security solution, developing/testing basic applications, and analyzing/fixing the security vulnerability of the application using open-source tools. 

## Objective: 
After completing this module, students should gain confidence and experience in participating and contributing to a team in developing an application and analyzing the security vulnerability of that application. They should also have better knowledge and deeper experience in applying various information security concepts and practices in a real-world scenario and environment.
